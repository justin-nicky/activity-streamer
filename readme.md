### Problem Statement:

shaiju signup at 10.30
rohan logout at 11.30
shaiju create a message, shaiju delete a message
In backend web application where a users can signup/login to the application do some CRUD operation (add,edit,delet,list messages).
These action should appear in the frontend application as activity streams. You can commit the code to github public repo and share to us. Technologies :HTML5,Javascript/React.js/Angular,PHP/node.js/Java/Python,socket.io,mongodb/mysql/postgresql .
You have to push the code in a github and share the repo details with us and need to mention the steps for running the application in README.md file

### Steps to run the application:

#1. Clone the repo.
#2. Make sure that you have installed node.
#3. place the `.env` file in the server directory.
#4. within the server directory, run: `npm i && npm start`
#5. Navigate to the client directory and run: `npm i && npm start`
#6. Make sure both client and server are running.
#7. You can go to `localhost:3000` from your browser and test the app.
#8. Go to the live-stream page to listen to the activities.
